# __ðŸ“‹ To do tasks__

In this stage, the following is to be done:

- Once a milestone delivery is added automatically to Github, the Coordinator and the Reviewer are notified in a message on Mattermost in the following channel.
- The Coordinator proceeds to add the necessary tags to the task, add it to the appropriate project, and assign it to the appropriate Reviewer. (The task will initially be not visible on the project board but rather in the Issues section.)
- The Coordinator moves the task to the "In Progress" status.
