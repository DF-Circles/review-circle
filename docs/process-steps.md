# Process Steps

## Full Process Documentation:

1. The process starts with a CSV, from DF Portal, containing:

    - A list of awarded teams
    - their emails
    - milestones data
    - …

2. Review circle coordinators assign a project code to each one of the awarded projects.
3. An Operations' Circle member uses the following code to extract and organize the milestones data into different tabs of a sheet,
4. An Operations' Circle member then forwards a Google form via email to each awarded team.

- The awarded team sends their data through the form,
- The sent information, and the milestone data, will populate in the following sheet.

5. The same reviewer that was previously selected for eligibility, and expert reviews, will be reviewing awarded projects milestones.
6. The coordinator to review the information is then notified through Mattermost.
7. Once the information about the team and their milestones is confirmed, the column Audited in the Projects info tab should be marked as Yes.
8. Once the auditing process is done, the contract will be automatically created and the link to its Google doc will be in the “Contract link” column of the Projects info tab.
9. The DF Operations Manager is notified through Mattermost to Review the document of the contract for any inconsistencies.
10. Once the review of the document is done and the “Contract audited?” column is marked as Yes, a link to its PDF format will be added automatically in the “Contract to be sent” column of the Projects info tab.
11. Once Deep Funding team confirms it through the "DF confirmation" column in the Projects info tab, the PDF will be automatically sent to the awarded team through the Document signing provider and added to the “Sent Contracts” folder for the current round in the Contracts folder (Review Drive).
12. Once the awarded team signs the contract, it is then forwarded to the person signing on behalf of Deep Funding.
13. Once a contract is Signed by all parties it is added to the “Signed by all” folder for the current round in the Contracts folder (Review Drive).
14. Once the contract is signed by all parties, the team and proposal data is added to the Milestone review database automatically.
15. Any issues faced during these steps are first dealt with by Coordinators of the Review Circle, for technical assistance the operation circle can be involved. Finally, the Deep Funding team is the last resource for any conflict or arising issues.
