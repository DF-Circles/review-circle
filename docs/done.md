# Done

In this stage, the following is to be done:

- After the Coordinator reviews the submission made by the Reviewers, the status of the proposal is changed to <mark>DONE</mark> on the spreadsheet if there are no issues with the proposal.
- The Coordinators aggregate all audited and finalized reviews in a spreadsheet.
- The spreadsheet is then sent to the Deep Funding team.
