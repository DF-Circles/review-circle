This review is done to give proposers the opportunity to correct any mistakes or omissions found by reviewers and have their work reassessed before a final decision on its eligibility.</p> <p>There are 2 teams of reviewers:</p> <ul> <li>Technical Team and</li> <li>Non-technical team (Business team)</li> </ul> <p>The Technical team is assigned to proposals from the Community Driven RFPs (Request for Proposals), New Projects, and RFP Design Pools. The Business team is assigned to proposals in the Marketing and Ideation Pools.</p> <p>There is also the Miscellaneous Pool.</p> <p>Proposals in this pool can fall under Technical or Business.</p> <p>PROCESS:</p> <ol> <li>The Review team is formed based on Pools and technical skill levels.</li> <li>Coordinators are assigned to each team of reviewers to oversee and support them throughout the Deep Funding round, though they may interact and overlap sometimes.</li> <li>The Coordinators will assign each proposal to a reviewer based on the number of submitted proposals in their designated pool. These assignments can be found here.</li> <li> <p>When assigned, the reviewer begins immediately to review the proposals for pool eligibility, milestone correctness and all other rules pertaining to the specific Deep Funding round and the pool entered. What to look out for:</p> <ul> <li>A.  Pool Allocation Compliance - Ensure that the submitted proposal is in the right pool. For instance, a proposal that aims to provide a service on the SingularityNET platform by integrating a custom knowledge graph builder with LLM capabilities cannot be in a Marketing pool but should rather be in the RFP pool.</li> <li>B. Pool Conditions Compliance- There are general rules that all pools have to comply with and also specific rules and conditions for each pool. The reviewer checks to see if the proposal has met these conditions.</li> <li>C.  Milestones Compliance- All proposals must have a breakdown of  milestones with deliverables and an attached budget to each milestone.</li> <li>D. Deep Funding Resources Request Confirmation- If the team requires SNET/DF personnel to engage in order for the project to deliver the milestones, they need to specify this in the proposal that the DF team has acknowledged and approved this. Else, it's not eligible.</li> <li>E. Pool Ideation - In this pool, proposers are required to be specific about any of the 4 topic developments in their proposal as stated in the rules. The topic developments are : Tangible deliverables such as a detailed project backlog, technical architecture, a clickable prototype, and preliminary market research. If the proposer doesn't go in any of these directions, it's a no-go for them.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The reviewers fill this form and input the information needed and submit to the coordinators, who then comment on the proposal alerting the proposal team of corrections to be made, if any.</p> </li> <li>Once the proposal teams have had opportunities to edit and realign their proposals based on reviewers feedback, the Coordinators will review each of the reviewer's determinations for accuracy and will refer the process to Deep Funding team for the next phase.</li> <li>Prior to the blog post announcing the final results of  eligible proposals, the coordinators will communicate to teams regarding the status of their proposals. This is to ensure transparency and clarity for all participants regarding the status of their submissions.</li> <li>The coordinators update the eligibility status in WordPress.
